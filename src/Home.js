    Although crime victimization rates have been decreasing in the United
    States, government spending on policing continues to increase.
    Simultaneously our prison population continues to increase, destroying the
    lives of countless Americans, who after serving lengthy jail or prison
    sentences, completing probation or parole, and paying hefty fines and
    restitution, are still increasingly finding themselves pushed out of their
    communities.
</p>
<p>
    We have all heard the shocking statistic: while only having 5% of the
    world’s overall population, the US has 25% of the world’s prison
    population. What fewer people realize is that although crime victimization
    rates have been decreasing, government spending on policing, at the
    federal, state, and local level, continue increasing. The path we have
    taken as a nation has been a failure. Many of us accept this fact and push
    it to the back of our conscience, hoping that someday, when the conditions
    are right, we will work towards criminal justice reform.
</p>
<p>
    That time must be now. With renewed support for criminal justice reform,
    and during a time of national reflection around the issues of policing and
    crime, we are presented with an opportunity to re-envision a rational and
    functional response to crime, one in which justice and rehabilitation are
    centered, and where the goal is freedom, for our communities, and those
    that have worked so, so hard but have long had it denied to them.
